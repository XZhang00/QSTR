If you proceed, you will only transition from one darkness to another, a darkness that is more profound and impenetrable
The path ahead will only lead you to a deeper and more pervasive darkness if you continue on your current course

Continuing on your journey will lead you from a darkness to a deeper and more encompassing darkness
The path forward will lead to an even more intense darkness if you choose to continue on your current path
